listen -- listen for connections on a socket

下面是OS X下的描述：

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     int
     listen(int socket, int backlog);

DESCRIPTION
     Creation of socket-based connections requires several operations.  First, a socket is created with socket(2).
     Next, a willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incoming connections are specified with
     listen().  Finally, the connections are accepted with accept(2).  The listen() call applies only to sockets of
     type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.

     The backlog parameter defines the maximum length for the queue of pending connections.  If a connection request
     arrives with the queue full, the client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED.  Alternatively,
     if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored so that retries may succeed.

RETURN VALUES
     The listen() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global vari-
     able errno is set to indicate the error.


一些测试结论：listen(listenfd, 0);
Linux下：backlog貌似和实现有关，具体的传值并没有生效；
OS X下：backlog是精确的，当为0时也可以建立多个连接；
