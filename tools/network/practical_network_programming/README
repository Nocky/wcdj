Prerequisites
Unix Network Programming by late W.Richard Stevens
(1) Know basics of TCP/IP, eg. IP addresses, ports
(2) Know how to write an echo server with basic sockets APIs.
Access to one or more Linux hosts. Sorry for Windows fans.
Knows about C++, Python or Go. Sorry for C folks.

What Unix Network Programming didn't teach
W.Richard Stevens planned to write three volumes of UNP2e
(1) Volume 1: Sockets API, published in 1998
(2) Volume 2: IPC, published in 1999
(3) VOlume 3: Applications
He passed away on Sept 1, 1999, unfortunately
Complex protocols, not just formatless echo or short lived daytime
Modern concurrent models: Thread-per-connection, non-blocking/event-driven/epoll, thread pool, etc.
(1) POSA2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects, pub in 2000

Highlights of this course
Focus on server-side TCP network programming
(1) No user interaction, runs for weeks not minutes
Measurable performance
(1) Myths busted
No hypothetic optimizations
(1) How many memory (de)allocs kernel does from receiving an Ethernet frame to passing TCP payload to your application?

Layered Network
Ethernet frame 帧
IP packet 分组
TCP segment 分节
Application message 消息

Common pitfalss of novices
Mix business logical with network IO, difficult to unit test
Incomplete data received from a TCP peer
Incorrectly determine message boundaries when using TCP
Sending C struct to peer
(1) Modify the global align setting causes core dump in 3rd party library
TCP self-connection(自连接): localhost:54321 <-> localhost:54321
Many more in non-blocking network programming

TCP/IP over 1Gb Ethernet(千兆网)
Ethernet frame
(1) Preamble 8 Bytes
(2) MAC      12 B
(3) Type     2B
(4) Payload  46~1500 B
(5) CRC      4B
(6) Gap      12B
Total    84~1538 B
Raw bandwidth 125MB/s
Packet per second
(1) Max 125,000,000 / 84 = 1,488,000
(2) Min 81,274 (no jumbo)
TCP/IP overhead
(1) IP header  20B
(2) TCP header 20B
(3) TCP option 12B(Timestamp)
Max TCP throughput
(1) 81274 * (1500 - 52) = 117,684,752
112MiB/s or 117MB/s
