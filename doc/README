You may use command [/sbin/sysctl -a | grep msg] to see current kernel paras, or use below command to see separately:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb, this means max size of a message queue.
cat /proc/sys/kernel/msgmax, this means max size of message (bytes).
cat /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni, this means max # of msg queue identifiers.
